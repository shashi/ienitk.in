title: IE Special Interest Groups (SIG)
author:

IE firmly believes in the process of knowledge exchange among its members. For this purpose, a number of *Special Interest Groups* have been introduced, where members regularly meet and engage in discussions, problem-solving and undertake new projects and activities. An inclusive approach to these programs is followed, with the intention of catering to the holistic growth and furthering the interests of every member. What’s more, members are encouraged to start their own SIGs and utilise the club to pursue common interests in a fruitful manner.

This year, we have several SIGs running:

h2. Core SIGs

Every member of IE must belong to one of these SIGs. These are intended to generate interest in technical/analytical fields and develop skills in the same.
* Garage
* Code
* Gadget
* Finance

h2. Auxillary SIGs

Purely interest-based, auxiliary SIGs can be about anything under the sun; in the past IE has had SIGs for music, reading, writing, astrophysics, eco-activism, Internet culture, poker, movies, and even adventure sports! Each batch that comes into IE brings a new flavor into the club in the form of these SIGs.

Presently active SIGs:
* GreenAid
* Computer History and Internet Culture SIG
* Amateur Writers’ Group

h2. Our SIGs - A bird’s eye-view

h3. Garage

!>{width: 400px; height: auto; }/images/blog/aero.jpg(Aero)! 

_The ultimate pitstop for those fascinated by dynamics, structures, materials and absolutely anything to do with machines!_

With no restrictions as to branch or specific areas of knowledge, the SIG demands nothing but a love for the field. Garage meets consist of open discussions and software tutorials, of heated debates and fascinating talks, all sprinkled between hardcore sessions on relevant _gyaan_.

The group is focused towards continuous learning and parallel application towards long-term projects.

*Some proposed activities and projects include:*
* Discussion of relevant problem statements from technical fests such as Engineer and    Shaastra.
* Talks, discussions and tutorials on computer-based modelling and design.
* Investigation of possible biomimicry applications for water conservation.
* Investigation of possible methods to counter oceanic oil spills.

_*SIG Heads*_ : Sumeet Kumar and Priyadarshini S.

h3. Code

The increasing number of collegiate programming and software development events in India and elsewhere highlighted the acute need for an open forum on coding, where beginners and old hands could come together and share expertise in an informal, mutually beneficial atmosphere. IE stepped in to fill this gap, and *Code* was born.

Members of this SIG share knowledge with fellow members and further their interests in the field.

Discussion of advanced techniques and problem statements from contests is  regular feature of this group. In addition, Code members organise such contests within college for the benefit of the student body of NITK.

*Some activities and projects include:*
* Conduction of regular codejams and other contests in college.
* Team-based participation in ICPC and other prestigious competitions.
* Along with Gadget, project on Sound-based 3-D Image Processing

_*SIG heads:*_ Vivek Ravindran and Naveen Kumar

h3. Gadget

!>{width: 300px; height: auto;}/images/blog/automata.jpg(Aero)! 

To obtain and share knowledge about basics of robotics, image processing, microcontroller programming and all related fields, a group of hugely talented IE members set up the Robotics SIG. Today, the group has evolved into Gadget, combining all that an electronics or gadget freak could dream of! Be it robotics, sensors, displays-they do it all.

*Some activities and projects include:*
* Series of lectures and hands-on sessions on basics of robotics, image processing, and other gadget technology.
* Discussion of problem statements from various fests.
* Along with Code, project on Sound-based 3-D Image Processing.

h3. Finance

This group was created to develop interest in the field of finance and provide exposure to applications of finance.

*Planned Activities*
* Regular talks on various finance related topics
* Discussion of related case studies
* Participation in related online and offline competitions

h3. GreenAid

The environmental and social wing of IE NITK, GreenAid aims to bring about social change and be an agent in ecological conservation. From spreading awareness to proactively taking up relevant projects, the group use the platform provided by IE SIGs to spread awareness about major social and environmental concerns
Running project

*Project Vriddhi:* Seeking to combine technical know-how with social responsibility, the team identifies daily problems faced by villages in the Mangalore-Udupi region and attempts to mitigate them using student resource, institute infrastructure and NGO support.

_*SIG in-charge:*_ Akanksha Sharma

h3. Computer History and Internet Culture

The ‘CHICSIG’ is a group of internet fanatics, meme nuts and computer history buffs. Through interactive discussions and talks, the group aims to make little known aspects of the internet more accessible to everyone.
Planned Activities

# Regular talks on various topics like internet memes, webcomics taking the internet by a storm, famous usenet flame wars.
# *Archive project:* To resurrect websites and resources that are dying of negligence, but have played a major part in the story of the internet.
# Setting up an IRC channel to share links, scripts and flame.

_*SIG in-charge:*_ Shashi Gowda


h3. Amateur Writers’ Group

In the absence of an effective mechanism to encourage writing and literary pursuits in NITK, IE steeped in with the Amateur Writers’ Group. Presently running on a popular social networking site, this group is open to all interested NITKians and holds regular contests. It ensures feedback and discussion sessions, providing the would-be Kiplings and RK Narayanans a much-needed outlet.
