IE SIGs take up and work on projects throughout the year. Here are a few.

## Code

### Scheme Physics

A virtual Physics world programmable with the Lisp dialect Scheme. There is a prototype we have [on github](http://sachinhosmani.github.com/Scheme-Physics). The main goal is pedagogy. We want to make a fun environment which DIY-ers in high school can use to explore scheme while learning to create physics by building a language.

### nitk.ac.in

The redesign from last year is a humongous kludge and was written in less than a 100 man-hours. We plan to make the platform much more well-engineered, robust and flexible for changes. We will be spending more time making design decisions than writing code in this project and hope it will be a good lesson in software engineering.

### 3D music visualizer

This is a project to use footage from depth-sensing cameras (e.g. Kinect) to create virtual 3D worlds which respond to music. We plan to make a music video at the end of it all, somewhat like this [Radiohead song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nTFjVm9sTQ).

## Garage

### Blackboard duster

Here we plan to build a prototype of an automatic blackboard duster which can work with existing blackboards. The focus is on making it dirt cheap by tweaking the product design.

### Glider

We plan to design and prototype a glider using sound knowledge of flight physics, and software modeling.

## Gadget

### Maze solver

This is a computer vision project, a maze solver robot implemented with the help of OpenCV.

### Automatic Lighting

Designing a cheap and effective product to help conserve energy in the hostels and labs in the college. The final goal is to propose this to the administration in a convincing manner.

## Finance

### Startup research

The Finance SIG is researching the top five startups from India. The hope is that the members will get insights as to what are the ingredients of a successful startup.
