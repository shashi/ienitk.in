title: Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
author:
---

To persue various interests the members have, IE has a number of *Special Interest Groups*, where group members regularly meet and engage in discussions, problem-solving and undertake new projects and activities. What's more, members are encouraged to start their own SIGs and utilise the club to pursue common interests in a fruitful manner.

Every member of IE must belong to one of these SIGs. These are intended to generate interest in technical/analytical fields and develop skills in the same.
* Code
* Garage
* Gadget
* Finance

Purely interest-based, auxiliary SIGs can be about anything under the sun; in the past IE has had SIGs for music, reading, writing, astrophysics, eco-activism, Internet culture, poker, movies, and even adventure sports! Each batch that comes into IE brings a new flavor into the club in the form of these SIGs.

Presently active SIGs:
* Design
* Films
* Theatre
* Philosophy
* GreenAid/Vriddhi
* Amature Writers' group

h2. Core SIGs

h3. Code

Code is the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence SIG. We believe and algorithms are only means to explore Computer Science and to craft beautiful software. We focus on the bigger ideas in our projects and discussions, and count on the do-it-yourself spirit to teach us inspiring and unexpected things that only experience can teach. We also have a penchant for Computer History.

One project we plan to continue this year is (for want of a better name) the Scheme-Physics project whose prototype can be found "here":(http://sachinhosmani.github.com/Scheme-Physics) (you'll need WebGL). It is a project to help high-schoolers learn to program in Scheme by exploring it via a virtual physics world. Kind of like LOGO, but in the browser and less abstract.

We have an orientation programme in the works, especially for our new recruits. Through this, we aim to accelerate their learning in programming, designing algorithms, artificial intelligence, web development, and core CS problems. After this, we will be shifting our focus to hands on projects and hackathons where people can work on their own ideas in small groups.

Code organizes rtfm, arguably the most pedagogical computer science event in college, and Mathematica, our math and logic quest. If you are a first year, look out for these.

h3. Garage

!>{width: 400px; height: auto; }/images/blog/aero.jpg(Aero)! 

Garage is the Mechanical SIG. This semester, Garage plans to complete a minimum of 3 working projects, two of which were initiated last year. The first one is on the quirky side - an automatic blackboard duster. Here we plan to build a prototype of an automatic blackboard duster which can work with existing blackboards. The focus is on making it dirt cheap by tweaking the product design. We also plan to make an RC plane to participate in the competition to be held during Engineer. The third project shall be decided based on the inputs of our new members. Apart from projects, we plan to become efficient with modeling software such as ANSYS, CATIA etc.

We also organize Sync, the DIY event for juniors where they get to build fun contraptions to serve weird purposes using inexpensive materials and jugaad.

h3. Gadget

!>{width: 300px; height: auto;}/images/blog/automata.jpg(Aero)! 

Gadget is the forum for members (and friends) who are into Electronics and Electrical engineering and related fields. Since most of the members (and friends) have an interest in image processing, we're kicking off with a game project with OpenCV. Later in the semester we plan to take on some Engineer problem statements and give our best shot. 

Gadget is also planning to organise project â€˜Fast Forward', where members present walkthroughs of projects they've done, from ideation to implementation to the challenges they faced. We organize Wired Up, an event for the circuit enthusiasts in first year that tests your basic electronics know-how and logical thinking skills.

Most importantly, we're hoping for participation from more non EC/EE folk and non IE members as well. If you're a tronix geek, this is the forum for you!

h3. Finance

"The first rule in making money is to not lose it."

This group was created to develop interest in the field of finance and provide exposure to applications of finance. Finance SIG has become a forum for Insvesting, Economics and Entrepreneurship.

*Planned Activities*
* Regular talks on various finance related topics
* Discussion of related case studies
* Participation in related online and offline competitions

The prime project of the sig for the next semester would be a study on the top 5 indian companies with innovative marketing strategies We also plan to screen a few documentaries related to finance and marketing. Looking forward to building nitk's new business and trading masterminds.

h2. Auxiliary SIGs

h3. GreenAid

The environmental and social wing of IE NITK, GreenAid aims to bring about social change and be an agent in ecological conservation. From spreading awareness to proactively taking up relevant projects, the group use the platform provided by IE SIGs to spread awareness about major social and environmental concerns
Running project

*Project Vriddhi:* Seeking to combine technical know-how with social responsibility, the team identifies daily problems faced by villages in the Mangalore-Udupi region and attempts to mitigate them using student resource, institute infrastructure and NGO support.

h3. Design

To help the right-brained among us channel our technical skills to make the most impact, this year we are starting the Design SIG.

bq. "Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design." - Herbert Simon

This year, we plan to have some lively discussions by way of exploring histories or dissecting examples. Some topics we are considering are typography, grids and geometry in presentation, colors, product design, ad placements, programming languages, basically anything that will inspire design. We believe these discussions will have immediate positive impact on the way one goes about making, say, a Photoshop job or a web page or a satellite.

h3. Films

The films SIG aims at providing a more in-depth perspective of cinema and its various aspects. There is a lot of general know-how to go around and the SIG will channel this in the form of discussions and presentations which offer a more detailed view of the different aspects of movies such as cinematography, camera work, scripting, score and story. Apart from introspection into existing movies, we also aim at developing projects involving the members of the club.

In the coming year, movies of various genres will be screened regularly, followed by a discussion. The major project under this SIG is the making of short films. This will provide an exposure to the practical aspects of filmmaking. Through this we plan to introduce a YouTube channel, similar to a podcast. We also aim to coordinate with members of the NITK Music Club (which has a sizable number of IE members) to develop original scores for the films. This will enable us to participate in various competitions across different colleges and conduct events of this kind for the first time in our college..

h3. Theatre

Theatre SIG is for the members enthusiastic about the artform.

This year at the Theatre SIG we'll be focussing on acting and scriptwriting. The hope is that participants can let go of themselves and learn how to use a stage to simulate an imagined reality.

h3. Philosophy

bq. The Answer to the Great Question... Of Life, the Universe and Everything... Is... Forty-two,' said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
--Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

We spend a lot of time learning about various aspects of our world without really spending a lot of time thinking about the bigger questions such as the political implications of the work we do, the validity of the assumptions in the subjects we study etc.

The philosophy SIG is an auxiliary SIG which started in the last semester and is open to anyone in college. We like to meet up once in awhile, take a break from our regular schedules and just discuss and think about various philosophical topics.

We have had discussions on a variety of topics ranging from Recursive Thinking and Artificial Intelligence from the book Godel Escher Bach to the insightful ideas presented in comics like Calvin And Hobbes.

In the coming year we plan to continue our discussions with topics ranging from political philosophy to the Matrix trilogy.

Since we already know the answer is forty two, we should probably spend the rest of our lives looking for the question. Feel free to come and help us and yourself take a few steps towards the questions.

h3. Amateur Writers' Group

In the absence of an effective mechanism to encourage writing and literary pursuits in NITK, IE steeped in with the Amateur Writers' Group. Presently running on a popular social networking site, this group is open to all interested NITKians and holds regular contests. It ensures feedback and discussion sessions, providing the would-be Kiplings and RK Narayanans a much-needed outlet.

Not on it yet? "Join immediately!":https://www.facebook.com/groups/153406361419250/members/

*Planned activities and projects*
# Continue the current online group where members post their work frequently and bring out more variety in the kind of writing and topics given.
# Create an anthology of stories and other literary works by NITKians, taking creative writing to the next level.
