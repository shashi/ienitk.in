h3. What we do

IE is structured as "SIGs":/sigs. Code, Gadget, Garage and Finance are the four core SIGs. Apart from these there are four auxiliary SIGs: Design, Films, Philosophy and Theatre. The SIGs frequently meet throughout the year, just to spend time talking about something or to work on projects. Know more on the "SIGs page":/sigs.

The 1989 batch of IE NITK(then KREC), was responsible for *TechnoKREC*--very first collegiate technical fest in India. IE is a major contributor to Engineer year after year.
